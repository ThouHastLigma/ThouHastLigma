Yo! wassup, names Liggy (landon) and right now, I have no idea on what I'm doing lmao

But what I do know is my interest in game development. I love playing video games, mainly fast paste games like Splatoon or Bomb Rush Cyberfunk and I've always wanted to make a movement based game.
As of right now, I'm thinkin' of a 2D action platformer type game. I'd like to integrate that fast paste movement kinda like BRC/JSR or even Wario Land 3/Pizzatower.

What I am working on as of right know, I'm working on my art skills (and eventually my music skills). I do plan on exploring this subject further by doing animations and possibly even try out different art styles.
Theres a lot of artist that inspire me to keep going. Artists like Loafbud, RechiTV, and jumpbreak (all artists are on twt btw)
There are also a bunch of musicians that inspire me to make music. Musicians like Hideki Naganuma ( worked on JSR, Sonic Rush, and BRC's soundtracks), Frizk (made all my fellas), Saruky (Made FNF Hotline 024 soundtrack), and YonKaGor (musician I really enjoy). I'd love to make music, but I have no idea where to start lol.
